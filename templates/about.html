      <p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: 400; text-align: justify; padding: 0 20px;">QuoteBot's story began in 2020, right in the midst of the pandemic. My friends and I were drowning in a sea of quotes in our Discord server. It was becoming extremely tedious to scroll through endless messages just to dig up a funny remark from a week ago. Fortunately, one of my friends had recently created a small Discord bot for a different project, and that's when we had a lightbulb moment to create QuoteBot! The first version of QuoteBot was as basic as it gets, with everything hard-coded and a very minimalist design. But it did the job. However, after a while, my friend graduated and we left QuoteBot pretty much untouched for an entire year. Eventually, I couldn't stand how unattractive and limited it looked, so I took it upon myself to give QuoteBot a makeover. I improved its aesthetics and functionality, even collaborating with that same friend remotely to learn how to implement a database. It made a world of difference. Once I had revamped QuoteBot and made it more user-friendly, I realized that there wasn't really any other bot out there quite like it. So, I decided to make it public, thinking that others might find it as useful and entertaining as we did. And that's when QuoteBot started making its mark in Discord communities. From that point on, it continued to evolve and become a cherished tool for preserving and sharing memorable quotes. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br><p style="text-align: center">And a massive thank you to all servers running QuoteBot! <3</p></p>
